# Data File Samples
The data sets have been described by Carlone et al. [1], [2], [3] and adapted to include fixed 
vertices. Other modifications have been performed as well to demonstrate the different 
vertex and edge types supported in gs-rs. The original data sets as well as more examples 
can be found [online](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/datasets/).
