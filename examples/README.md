# gs-rs Examples

These examples show how to optimize as well as visualize factor graphs with gs-rs and what the datasets in the supported file types should look like.

## Datasets

The datasets have been described by Carlone et al. [1] and adapted to include fixed vertices. Other modifications have been performed as well to demonstrate the different vertex and edge types supported in gs-rs. The original datasets as well as more examples can be found online [2].
