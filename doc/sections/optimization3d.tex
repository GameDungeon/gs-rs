% TODO quaternion part will only have three entries
% TODO similarities in all 3D factors (skew, ...(?))
In the following sections, the individual 3D factors' calculations of $J$ and $e$ are presented.



\subsection{Position3D}
% TODO document optimization



\subsection{Odometry3D}
% TODO document optimization
