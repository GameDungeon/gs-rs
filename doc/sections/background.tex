\section{Background Literature}
The optimization algorithm used by \textbf{gs-rs} is based on parts of \textbf{g2o}. This paper should suffice to understand the optimization's implementation in \textbf{gs-rs}. The following papers by the developers of \textbf{g2o} are recommended if a deeper understanding of the theory behind the algorithm is of interest:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{g2o: A General Framework for Graph Optimization, KÃ¼mmerle~et~al.}~\cite{kummerle2011g2o}: This paper documents the derivation of the algorithm's structure.
	\item \textit{A Tutorial on Graph-Based SLAM, Grisetti~et~al.}~\cite{grisetti2010tutorial}: This paper contains additional comments on the calculations in 2D and 3D. Here it is presented how the least squares optimization works on a manifold.
\end{itemize}
